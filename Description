ðŸ“Š Credit Card Customer Segmentation
ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

Banks struggle to understand different types of credit card users.
Not all customers behave the same â€” some spend heavily on one-off purchases, some prefer installments, while others rarely use their credit card.

Goal: Segment customers into distinct groups to enable personalized marketing strategies, cross-sell opportunities, and churn reduction.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset

Source: Public dataset of credit card transactions & behavior.

Features include:

Balance, Purchases, One-off vs Installment Purchases

Cash Advances & Frequency

Credit Limit

Payments & Minimum Payments

Tenure

ðŸ”¹ Approach

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Purchase patterns (One-off, Installments, Both)

Spending frequency & credit utilization

Missing values imputed with column means

Feature Engineering

Added Purchase_Type column (One-off / Installment / Both).

Selected behavioral + financial features for clustering.

Data Preprocessing

Scaled features using StandardScaler.

Reduced dimensions for visualization using PCA.

Clustering (K-Means)

Optimal cluster count determined via Elbow Method.

Customers segmented into 4 key groups.

ðŸ”¹ Insights from Clusters

Cluster 0 â€“ Luxury Spenders ðŸ’³
High one-off purchases, high credit limits, full repayments.

Cluster 1 â€“ Installment Lovers ðŸ›’
Prefer installment purchases, moderate balance, steady payments.

Cluster 2 â€“ Cash Advance Users ðŸ’µ
Heavy reliance on cash advances, irregular repayments.

Cluster 3 â€“ Conservative Users ðŸ“‰
Low spending, low frequency, minimal credit usage.

ðŸ”¹ Business Impact

Banks can leverage segmentation to:
âœ” Design tailored offers (cashback, EMI, rewards).
âœ” Identify high-risk customers (default-prone cash advance users).
âœ” Improve customer retention with personalized experiences.
