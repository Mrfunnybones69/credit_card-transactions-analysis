ðŸ”¹ **Problem Statement** :

Banks struggle to understand different types of credit card users.
Not all customers behave the same â€” some spend heavily on one-off purchases, some prefer installments, while others rarely use their credit card.

**Goal**: Segment customers into distinct groups to enable personalized marketing strategies, cross-sell opportunities, and churn reduction.
